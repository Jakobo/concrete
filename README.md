# Concrete
Concrete is a lightweight Html5 Canvas framework that enables hit detection, layer support, pixel ratio management, exports, and downloads

As the creator of KineticJS, author of HTML5 Canvas Cookbook, founder of HTML5CanvasTutorials.com, founder of MeteorCharts, and the lead data visualization engineer at Platfora, I've identified a handful of features that just about every HTML5 Canvas project needs.  Concrete packages up these features into a lightweight framework of about 600 lines of JavaScript, including documentation.
