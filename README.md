# Candy
A sweet, fat free, HTML5 canvas utility library for all ages.

As the creator of KineticJS, author of HTML5 Canvas Cookbook, founder of HTML5CanvasTutorials.com, founder of MeteorCharts, and the lead data visualization engineer at Platfora, I've identified a handful of requirements that just about every HTML5 Canvas project needs.  You can think of Candy as the super light weight version of KineticJS, which grew quite large over the years.  KineticJS is a heavier framework like Ember or Angular, while Candy is a light weight utility library like underscore.  Enjoy.
