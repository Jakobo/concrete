# Candy
A sweet, fat free, HTML5 canvas library for all ages.

As the creator of KineticJS, author of HTML5 Canvas Cookbook, founder of HTML5CanvasTutorials.com, founder of MeteorCharts, and the lead data visualization engineer at Platfora, I've identified a handful of features that just about every HTML5 Canvas project needs.  Candy packages up these features into a lightweight library of about 600 lines of JavaScript, including documentation.  

## Features
* hit detection
* layer management
* pixel ratio support
* png export
* download
